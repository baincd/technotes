This is a collection of notes, snippets, and scripts to prevent me from having to "reinvent of the wheel" and therefore allow me to create awesomeness faster.  

Basically this repo is just a reference for myself, but I happily provide it publicly in case anything here is beneficial to others.

Many of the details come or derive from other sources on the Internet.  Unfortunately, some of these sources have been lost over time.  I sincerely apologize in advance to any original authors whom I have not cited, and to anyone else for whom this is an inconvenience.

I will happily consider any suggestions or corrections, however it will fully be my discretion what I do with any suggestions or corrections.  My repo, my rules.

This repo is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.  The author will not be held responsible for anything, good or bad, that results from using any information, scripts, or code in this repo.  Pay attention to what you are doing at all times.  Do not code or sudo while impaired.  You have been warned.
