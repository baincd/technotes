Why I prefer Eclipse of IntelliJ

1. IntelliJ is ugly
2. IntelliJ Indicators (errors and warnings) are hard to see
3. IntelliJ is quick to setup if your project follows conventions, but is painful to use if anything goes against convention
4. IntelliJ window splitting is cumbersome to use and limited
5. IntelliJ view layout is limited
6. IntelliJ default shortcuts are non-intuitive
